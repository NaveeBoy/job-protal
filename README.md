Developed a full-stack web application using ReactJS and Node.js, with MongoDB as the database. The platform 
facilitates job postings, applications, CV uploads, and user management. It features three main user roles: admin, 
companies, and job seekers. Admins can manage users and job posts, companies can post jobs and review 
applications, and job seekers can apply for jobs and upload their CVs. This project demonstrates my proficiency in 
modern web development technologies and my ability to create functional, user-centric applications.
